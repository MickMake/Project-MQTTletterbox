Remember that thing in front of your house? The letterbox. In this multi-part video I'll show you how easy it is to get your letterbox to send you alerts via MQTT when you get new mail. So you won't have to guess anymore.

For those people who've been around the UNIX systems scene for years will know about Jamie Zawinski and his famous law of software envelopment, (aka Feature Creep), which is:

	"Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can."

Well, in this particular project, this is where I start.
